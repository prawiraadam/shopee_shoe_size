# shopee_shoe_size

Crawl data from Shopee website, then use the data to see which shoe size sold the most within certain period of time.
The python script is executed manually around 18.00 PM.

# Data collection method
Using 2 local brand for footwear, Ventela and Warrior, since their price is considered as affordable and the number of items sold are mostly over 1000. Product that I choose in this project are first 5 stores that shows with the keyword of 'Ventela' or 'Sepatu Warrior' and after sorting the results further by 'Terlaris'. After that, I sort each stores product based on 'Terlaris', and then pick the top 2 product. 

# Project goal
The goal of this project is only about shoe size, and it might be useful if one wants to build a footwear brand with tight budget so they could determine which size they should stock effectively.

# Future works
Future works regarding this project may include trends about shoe color, price range, or cut-type of the shoe.
