# shopee_shoe_size

Crawl data from Shopee website, then use the data to see which shoe size sold the most within certain period of time.
Using 2 local brand for footwear, Ventela and Warrior, since their price is considered as affordable and the number of items sold are mostly over 1000.
The goal of this project is only about shoe size, and it might be useful if one wants to build a footwear brand with tight budget so they could determine which size they should stock effectively.
Future works regarding this project may include trends about shoe color, price range, or cut-type of the shoe.
